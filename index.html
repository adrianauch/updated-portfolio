                Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently working to become a full stack
                developer at University of Denver, and I have an expected graduation
                date of October 2021. Additonally, I have my bachelors degree in
                Political Science and a minor in English Litature from University of
                Colorado, Boulder. Sko Buffs!
              </p>
              <p>
                Previously, I worked at a tech start-up as a workforce management
                analyst. Where I forcasted staffing and made intraday changes to meet
                company service level goals. Additionally, I worked to create hiring
                plans to maintain staff to meet service level goals and call quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                I decided to make a career change to work in a field that allows for
                more creativity. While allowing me to continue to use my strategic
                thinking and problem solving skills. I look forward to being an ever
                evolving developer that can create web applications that preform
                effortlessly and efficiently.

              <p>This project was developed to aide anyone who loves to cook and create their own cocktails but is burdened with indecisiveness. Our Delishery website will walk through through a few simple questions and will present you with a randomized meal recipe and drink recipe. If you don't like the meal, you can start again and get completely new results! Once you find that perfect match, you can print the recipe off.</p>

              <p>This command line application was generated to help a user create a quick reference for their team. The application generates an HTML file where the user would has access to see their information. The cards include employeer information for name, email and comapny ID. Then each role (Manager, Intern and Engineer) has individualized information that pertains to their job. Teh card is generated with this name and role at the top of the card and their information below. The application utilized the command line in the terminal to ask the user prompts and the user simply has to answer the prompts and an HTML will be gernerated. The user can determine how many employees they want to include on eact team.</p>

                    The web application will generate a password based on user criteria. The user is able to pick the length of password between 8 and 128 characters. If the user selects an amount outside of the specified range they will be alerted to restart. The user will then have the ability to pick if they would like their password to include upper-case letters, lower-case letters, number or special characters. The application will check to enusure that the user selected at least one type of character. The application will then produce an random password based on the users selections. The application is a adptive to display on different screen sizes.

                      <p>NFT stands for non-fungible tokens. NFTs exist on the blockchain, which is a public ledger that records transactions. An NFT is created from digital objects that represent both tangible and intangible items, such as Art, Gifs, Music etc. Essentially, NFT are digital collectors items,. Think baseball cards but digital. They are popular because they are on the blockchain so they can only have one owner at a time and they are nearly impossible to copy.

                        NFT's are blowing up the digital art and collectable world. Digital art and collectables market has started to explode thanks to the blockchains. The recent boom in the NFT opened a space for new online marketplaces for artists and collectors to buy and sell NFTs.
                        
                        NFTy was created to give creators and investors the ability to sell and buy exclusively digital objects that range from funky 3D videos to images of famous tweets and everything in between.</p>

                  <p>The web application was created for a user to be able to use and a daily planner with hourly blocks to write in notes/scheduled items. The planner has the current date and the hour sections are color coded to represent the current hour (red), upcoming hours (green) and past hours are greyed out, to help users visually as the day goes on. The data is stored in local storage so the user can exit out of the application and re-open it later with out losing their notes/schedule. The main problem the pallner solves is to provide the user with a basic simple way to keep track of events throughout their day. I learned how to take pre-existing code and make it interactive for users. I also finally figured out how to use local storage and store variables where users can access them later. Additionally, using momnet made displaying time and dates so easy and will be a great tool to use in the future.</p>

                    The motivation behind creating this web application is to give the user the ablility to view the weather in a certain location. Additionally, the application has teh functionality to look up weather data for the current date and a glimpse of the next 5 day forcast. The application is able to pull in weather data for Humity, Wind, Temp, and the current date. The application saves search history to allow the see their recent searches. The app gathers data from an API - openweathermap.org. I was able to learn a lot from the application escpically pulling in data from a third-party API. I learned that when working with API keys you might have to wait a while for the key to work and that imperial is used for the US in terms of units for the particular API that I used in this application. Additionally, I learned how to use jQuery to convert the data into a readable date for the user. The most challenging peice of the application to build was pulling in the icons from the API. Unfortuantely, I was unable to pull in the uv index into the application.
